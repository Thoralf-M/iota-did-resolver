# IOTA DID EXPLORER

Try it out here https://thoralf-m.github.io/iota-did-resolver/

Using the Wasm bindings from <https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs>

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm i
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
